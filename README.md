# spaceInvaders
A Space Invaders game my friends and I make in a class group challenge. It's one file in C++, and uses ASCII code for graphics.

The SpaceInvaders01 is the original file as of the end of the team challenge. Any new changes or features will be using a
copy of that as the source material for a new project.

# Terminal Space Invaders
A Terminal-based Space Invaders game my friends and I made in our first Computer Science class. This was for the final group challenge, took around 3 hours to write, and won us the challenge! It's all in one C++ file, and the hopefully some of the ugliest code I will ever commit! :)
